# Microsoft Engage Mentorship program'22 Project   
## Algorithms (Recommendation Engine)
### üö© Overview 
The purpose of the project is to get Content based recommendation which ensures that the content you are are watching is appeasing.
This project is solely built during the period of **Microsoft Engage Mentorship program'22** conducted by Microsoft provide mentorship and to enrich freshmen with various software development techniques.  
#### Problem statement (as given)
Demonstrate through your app the different kinds of algorithms that a web-streaming app (like Netflix) or an audio-streaming app (like Spotify) may use for their Recommendation Engine.  

- [x] Status : Accomplised by making a KNN model which recommend movie based on given movie. 

##### Adopt feature:
To build a fully functional app which demonstrates algorithms take place in recommender system.   
- [x] Status : Accomplished

## üö© Agile methology and workflow:

Agile methology was followed by implementation of 
KNN algorithm on the PCA transformed data which is pre-processed in the jupyter-notebook.
The methods were performed using git version control system and successfully developed patches which were merged to main branch. Methods were performed according to priority scale.
Priority scale : P5 (maximum) to P1 (Least)

| The data is static, i.e. more movie data can't be added due to project size constraints, instead making it dynamic by fetching movies from internet using TMDb API and the ratings data is being taken directly from the user | The data will become dynamic so the project can be made for long run  |
