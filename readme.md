# Microsoft Engage Mentorship program'22 Project   
## Algorithms (Recommendation Engine)
### ‚¶æ Overview 
The purpose of the application is to demonstrate algorithms which are used to provide content-based recommendations, which ensures that the content you are watching is pleasing. This project is solely built during the period of the **Microsoft Engage Mentorship program '22**,¬†conducted by Microsoft to provide mentorship and to enrich freshmen with various software development techniques.
#### Problem statement (as given)
Demonstrate through your app the different kinds of algorithms that a web-streaming app (like Netflix) or an audio-streaming app (like Spotify) may use for their recommendation engine.

- [x] Status: Accomplished by making a KNN model that recommends movies based on user data or a given movie. 

##### Adopt feature:
To make an app that is fully functional and demonstrates how algorithms work in a recommender system.  
- [x] Status: Accomplished

## ‚¶æ Agile methology and workflow:

The Agile methodology was followed by the implementation of the KNN algorithm on the PCA transformed data, which was earlier preprocessed in the jupyter-notebook. The methods were performed using the git version control system and successfully developed patches which were merged into the main branch. Methods were performed according to the priority scale given below:
Priority scale: P5 (highest) to P1 (lowest).

**Other Features:**
1. Change some sections of their profile (email change).
2. Get suggestions based on which movies they liked.
3. It contains an administration section which can control other profiles.¬†
4. The data includes movies from 2000‚Äì2019, so users are more familiar with them.

| Links to subscription services where you can rent or purchase movies                                                                                                                                                                  | It will help users directly find movies and watch them comfortably.              |
| Instead of adding just one trailer link, there are multiple trailers and teasers too.                                                                                                                                                 | It will eventually increase user convenience.                                    |
| The data is static, i.e. more movie data can't be added due to project size constraints. Instead, make it dynamic by fetching movies from the internet using the TMDb API and the ratings data is being taken directly from the user. | The data will become dynamic, so the project will be beneficial in the long run. |
